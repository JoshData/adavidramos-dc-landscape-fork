Maps and spatial data for Washington, D.C. landscape history. 

## Boschke Map datasets

Several datasets are digitized from Albert Boschke's 1856–1858 survey and map of the District of Columbia.

*boschke_1857/hydrography*: streams, represented as lines.

*boschke_1857/water*: large water bodies – canals and ponds.

*boschke_1857/marsh*: areas indicated as marsh on the source map. The engravers distinguish between marsh and tidal flats.

*boschke_1857/boschke 1857 georef*: a scanned copy of the Boschke map, georeferenced and stored in WGS84.

## Other datasets

*springs*: estimated locations of historic springs, based on descriptions in Williams. I've used contemporary maps and historic maps to help with the guesswork. 

## Coordinate system

All data are stored in WGS84, unless otherwise noted.
